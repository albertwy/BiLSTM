an entertaining british hybrid of comedy , caper thrills and quirky romance . 
sometimes smart but more often sophomoric . 
given that both movies expect us to root for convicted violent felons over those assigned to protect us from same , we need every bit of sympathy the cons can muster ; this time , there isn't much .

mocking kung fu pictures when they were a staple of exploitation theater programming was witty . mocking them now is an exercise in pointlessness . 
just another combination of bad animation and mindless violence . . . lacking the slightest bit of wit or charm .

such an incomprehensible mess that it feels less like bad cinema than like being stuck in a dark pit having a nightmare about bad cinema . 
the minor figures surrounding [bobby] . . . form a gritty urban mosaic . 
where janice beard falters in its recycled aspects , implausibility , and sags in pace , it rises in its courageousness , and comedic employment . 
there are deeply religious and spiritual people in this world who would argue that entering a church , synagogue or temple doesn't mean you have to check your brain at the door . the same should go for movie theaters .

lavishly , exhilaratingly tasteless . 
hardly a film that comes along every day . 
even when it drags , we are forced to reflect that its visual imagination is breathtaking
frank capra played this story straight . but the 2002 film doesn't really believe in it , and breaks the mood with absurdly inappropriate 'comedy' scenes .

although tender and touching , the movie would have benefited from a little more dramatic tension and some more editing . 
together , tok and o orchestrate a buoyant , darkly funny dance of death . in the process , they demonstrate that there's still a lot of life in hong kong cinema . 
this strenuously unfunny showtime deserves the hook . 
 . . . a trashy little bit of fluff stuffed with enjoyable performances and a bewildering sense of self-importance
an intimate contemplation of two marvelously messy lives . 
a truly moving experience , and a perfect example of how art -- when done right -- can help heal , clarify , and comfort . 
the best that can be said about the work here of scottish director ritchie . . . is that he obviously doesn't have his heart in it . 
begins as a promising meditation on one of america's most durable obsessions but winds up as a slender cinematic stunt . 
a playful iranian parable about openness , particularly the need for people of diverse political perspectives to get along despite their ideological differences . 
returning director rob minkoff . . . and screenwriter bruce joel rubin . . . have done a fine job of updating white's dry wit to a new age . 
to the civilized mind , a movie like ballistic : ecks vs . sever is more of an ordeal than an amusement . 
the sweetest thing leaves a bitter taste . 
one-sided documentary offers simplistic explanations to a very complex situation . . . . stylistically , the movie is a disaster . 
see it now , before the inevitable hollywood remake flattens out all its odd , intriguing wrinkles . 
earnest yet curiously tepid and choppy recycling in which predictability is the only winner . 
deliberately and devotedly constructed , far from heaven is too picture postcard perfect , too neat and new pin-like , too obviously a recreation to resonate . 
so relentlessly wholesome it made me want to swipe something . 
well-meant but unoriginal . 
adams , with four scriptwriters , takes care with the characters , who are so believable that you feel what they feel . 
a well-done film of a self-reflexive , philosophical nature . 
excessive , profane , packed with cartoonish violence and comic-strip characters .

fans of behan's work and of irish movies in general will be rewarded by borstal boy . 
should have gone straight to video . it looks like an action movie , but it's so poorly made , on all levels , that it doesn't even qualify as a spoof of such . 
the experience of going to a film festival is a rewarding one ; the experiencing of sampling one through this movie is not . 
what [frei] gives us . . . is a man who uses the damage of war -- far more often than the warfare itself -- to create the kind of art shots that fill gallery shows .

nothing more than a stifling morality tale dressed up in peekaboo clothing .

 . . . turns so unforgivably trite in its last 10 minutes that anyone without a fortified sweet tooth will likely go into sugar shock . 
care deftly captures the wonder and menace of growing up , but he never really embraces the joy of fuhrman's destructive escapism or the grace-in-rebellion found by his characters .

steven soderbergh's digital video experiment is a clever and cutting , quick and dirty look at modern living and movie life . 
i'm not generally a fan of vegetables but this batch is pretty cute . 
the film is itself a sort of cinematic high crime , one that brings military courtroom dramas down very , very low . 
this new movie version of the alexandre dumas classic is the stuff of high romance , brought off with considerable wit .

outer-space buffs might love this film , but others will find its pleasures intermittent . 
the camera soars above the globe in dazzling panoramic shots that make the most of the large-screen format , before swooping down on a string of exotic locales , scooping the whole world up in a joyous communal festival of rhythm . 
it's another stale , kill-by-numbers flick , complete with blade-thin characters and terrible , pun-laden dialogue . 
reggio's continual visual barrage is absorbing as well as thought-provoking .

offers absolutely nothing i hadn't already seen . 
the milieu is wholly unconvincing . . . and the histrionics reach a truly annoying pitch . 
malone does have a gift for generating nightmarish images that will be hard to burn out of your brain . but the movie's narrative hook is way too muddled to be an effectively chilling guilty pleasure . 
this re-do is so dumb and so exploitative in its violence that , ironically , it becomes everything that the rather clumsy original was railing against . 
initial strangeness inexorably gives way to rote sentimentality and mystical tenderness becomes narrative expedience . 
campanella's competent direction and his excellent cast overcome the obstacles of a predictable outcome and a screenplay that glosses over rafael's evolution . 
intelligent , caustic take on a great writer and dubious human being . 
 . . . fifty minutes of tedious adolescent melodramatics followed by thirty-five minutes of inflated nonsense .

on its icy face , the new film is a subzero version of monsters , inc . , without the latter's imagination , visual charm or texture . 
the path ice age follows most closely , though , is the one established by warner bros . giant chuck jones , who died a matter of weeks before the movie's release . 
a confluence of kiddie entertainment , sophisticated wit and symbolic graphic design . 
jeffrey tambor's performance as the intelligent jazz-playing exterminator is oscar-worthy . 
there are some laughs in this movie , but williams' anarchy gets tiresome , the satire is weak . 
perfectly pitched between comedy and tragedy , hope and despair , about schmidt instead comes far closer than many movies to expressing the way many of us live -- someplace between consuming self-absorption and insistently demanding otherness .
