mckay seems embarrassed by his own invention and tries to rush through the intermediary passages , apparently hoping that the audience will not notice the glaring triteness of the plot device he has put in service . 
even if britney spears is really cute , her movie is really bad . 
much of the movie 's charm lies in the utter cuteness of stuart and margolo . their computer-animated faces are very expressive . 
the performances are uniformly good . 
sometimes , nothing satisfies like old-fashioned swashbuckling . and in this regard , on guard delivers . 
i encourage young and old alike to go see this unique and entertaining twist on the classic whale 's tale -- you wo n't be sorry ! 
was that movie nothing more than a tepid exercise in trotting out a formula that worked five years ago but has since lost its fizz ? 
the new insomnia is a surprisingly faithful remake of its chilly predecessor , and when it does elect to head off in its own direction , it employs changes that fit it well rather than ones that were imposed for the sake of commercial sensibilities . 
for all its impressive craftsmanship , and despite an overbearing series of third-act crescendos , lily chou-chou never really builds up a head of emotional steam . 
a good-natured ensemble comedy that tries hard to make the most of a bumper cast , but never quite gets off the ground . 
works because , for the most part , it avoids the stupid cliches and formulaic potholes that befall its brethren . 
imagine ( if possible ) a pasolini film without passion or politics , or an almodovar movie without beauty or humor , and you have some idea of the glum , numb experience of watching o fantasma . 
the ending is a cop-out . what happens to john q ? i do n't have an i am sam clue . 
. . . a quietly introspective portrait of the self-esteem of employment and the shame of losing a job . . . 
'es en verdad una pena que mandoki esté realizando cintas tan malas desde hace algún tiempo , pues talento tiene , pero quién sabe dónde lo tiene escondido . ' 
a comedy that is warm , inviting , and surprising . 
the filmmakers juggle and juxtapose three story lines but fail to come up with one cogent point , unless it 's that life stinks , especially for sensitive married women who really love other women .

a resonant tale of racism , revenge and retribution . 
what could have been a daytime soap opera is actually a compelling look at a young woman 's tragic odyssey .

É uma pena que , mais tarde , o próprio filme abandone o tom de paródia e passe a utilizar os mesmos clichês que havia satirizado . 
suffers from unlikable characters and a self-conscious sense of its own quirky hipness . 
it 's all pretty tame . the most offensive thing about the movie is that hollywood expects people to pay to see it . 
to the filmmakers , ivan is a prince of a fellow , but he comes across as shallow and glib though not mean-spirited , and there 's no indication that he 's been responsible for putting together any movies of particular value or merit . 
the fourth `` pokemon `` is a diverting -- if predictable -- adventure suitable for a matinee , with a message that cautions children about disturbing the world 's delicate ecological balance . 
what madonna does here ca n't properly be called acting -- more accurately , it 's moving and it 's talking and it 's occasionally gesturing , sometimes all at once . 
this quiet , introspective and entertaining independent is worth seeking . 
lightweight but appealing . 
if damon and affleck attempt another project greenlight , next time out they might try paying less attention to the miniseries and more attention to the film it is about . 
kids will love its fantasy and adventure , and grownups should appreciate its whimsical humor . 
to build a feel-good fantasy around a vain dictator-madman is off-putting , to say the least , not to mention inappropriate and wildly undeserved . 
a 75-minute sample of puerile rubbish that is listless , witless , and devoid of anything resembling humor . 
an interesting psychological game of cat-and-mouse , three-dimensional characters and believable performances all add up to a satisfying crime drama . 
the trouble is , its filmmakers run out of clever ideas and visual gags about halfway through . 
it appears that something has been lost in the translation to the screen . 
visually imaginative , thematically instructive and thoroughly delightful , it takes us on a roller-coaster ride from innocence to experience without even a hint of that typical kiddie-flick sentimentality . 
hands down the year 's most thought-provoking film . but it pays a price for its intricate intellectual gamesmanship .

even if the enticing prospect of a lot of nubile young actors in a film about campus depravity did n't fade amid the deliberate , tiresome ugliness , it would be rendered tedious by avary 's failure to construct a story with even a trace of dramatic interest . 
[ shyamalan ] turns the goose-pimple genre on its empty head and fills it with spirit , purpose and emotionally bruised characters who add up to more than body count . 
at best this is a film for the under-7 crowd . but it would be better to wait for the video . and a very rainy day . 
delirious fun . 
this goofy gangster yarn never really elevates itself from being yet another earnestly generic crime-busting comic vehicle -- a well-intentioned remake that shows some spunk and promise but fails to register as anything distinctive or daring

if swimfan does catch on , it may be because teens are looking for something to make them laugh . 
the director mostly plays it straight , turning leys ' fable into a listless climb down the social ladder . 
an engrossing and grim portrait of hookers : what they think of themselves and their clients . 
this is n't a retooled genre piece , the tale of a guy and his gun , but an amiably idiosyncratic work . 
as social exposé , skins has its heart in the right place , but that 's not much to hang a soap opera on . 
not only is undercover brother as funny , if not more so , than both austin powers films , but it 's also one of the smarter , savvier spoofs to come along in some time . 
chicago offers much colorful eye candy , including the spectacle of gere in his dancing shoes , hoofing and crooning with the best of them . 
forages for audience sympathy like a temperamental child begging for attention , giving audiences no reason to truly care for its decrepit freaks beyond the promise of a reprieve from their incessant whining . 
in the real world , an actor this uncharismatically beautiful would have a résumé loaded with credits like `` girl in bar # 3 . `` 
astonishing is n't the word -- neither is incompetent , incoherent or just plain crap . indeed , none of these words really gets at the very special type of badness that is deuces wild . 
the actresses may have worked up a back story for the women they portray so convincingly , but viewers do n't get enough of that background for the characters to be involving as individuals rather than types . 
whether you 're moved and love it , or bored or frustrated by the film , you 'll still feel something . 
the movie has an avalanche of eye-popping visual effects . 
the intent is almost exactly the same [ as the full monty ] . all that 's missing is the spontaneity , originality and delight .

it feels like an after-school special gussied up with some fancy special effects , and watching its rote plot points connect is about as exciting as gazing at an egg timer for 93 minutes . 
to my taste , the film 's comic characters come perilously close to being amoses and andys for a new generation . 
i can easily imagine benigni 's pinocchio becoming a christmas perennial . coal is n't as easy to come by as it used to be and this would be a worthy substitute for naughty children 's stockings . 
a vile , incoherent mess . . . a scummy ripoff of david cronenberg 's brilliant 'videodrome . ' 
rich in shadowy metaphor and as sharp as a samurai sword , jiang wen 's devils on the doorstep is a wartime farce in the alternately comic and gut-wrenching style of joseph heller or kurt vonnegut . 
fairly run-of-the-mill . 
looks more like a travel-agency video targeted at people who like to ride bikes topless and roll in the mud than a worthwhile glimpse of independent-community guiding lights . 
this extremely unfunny film clocks in at 80 minutes , but feels twice as long . 
what time is it there ? is not easy . it haunts you , you ca n't forget it , you admire its conception and are able to resolve some of the confusions you had while watching it .

a triumph , relentless and beautiful in its downbeat darkness . 
the film is surprisingly well-directed by brett ratner , who keeps things moving well -- at least until the problematic third act . 
very stupid and annoying . 
this thing is just garbage . 
hugely accomplished slice of hitchcockian suspense . 
overall , the film misses the brilliance of jelinek 's novel by some way . it settles for being merely grim . 
boasts eye-catching art direction but has a forcefully quirky tone that quickly wears out its limited welcome .

turturro is fabulously funny and over the top as a 'very sneaky ' butler who excels in the art of impossible disappearing/reappearing acts

stale and clichéd to a fault . 
with we were soldiers , hollywood makes a valiant attempt to tell a story about the vietnam war before the pathology set in .

pompous and garbled . 
adaptation is simply brilliant . 
to the vast majority of more casual filmgoers , it will probably be a talky bore .

the movie 's gloomy atmosphere is fascinating , though , even if the movie itself does n't stand a ghost of a chance . 
truth to tell , if you 've seen more than half-a-dozen horror films , there 's nothing here you have n't seen before . 
a dramatic comedy as pleasantly dishonest and pat as any hollywood fluff . 
moore provides an invaluable service by sparking debate and encouraging thought . better still , he does all of this , and more , while remaining one of the most savagely hilarious social critics this side of jonathan swift . 
with a tone as variable as the cinematography , schaeffer 's film never settles into the light-footed enchantment the material needs , and the characters ' quirks and foibles never jell into charm .
